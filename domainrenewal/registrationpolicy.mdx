Registration Policy refers to the predetermined rules or guidelines governing the timing and duration of domain registration. It determines when a domain registration will expire and how it will be renewed. The Registration Policy field in the domain portfolio displays the selected policy option using a corresponding ID. To enhance clarity and user understanding, we have replaced the ID numbers with their respective text values in the domain portfolio.

The following are the text values associated with each ID:

| Value | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Normal              | This policy sets the domain registration to expire based on the regular renewal cycle determined by the registry or registrar. |
| Minus one day       | With this policy, the domain registration expires one day before the regular renewal date. |
| Minus one week      | The domain registration expires one week before the regular renewal date. |
| Minus one month     | This policy causes the domain registration to expire one month prior to the regular renewal date. |
| Minus two months    | The domain registration expires two months before the regular renewal date. |
| Set to December 31  | With this policy, the domain registration is set to expire on December 31 of the corresponding year, regardless of the regular renewal date. |

By displaying the text values instead of the ID numbers in the domain portfolio, users can easily identify and understand the specific registration policy applied to each domain. This information plays a crucial role in managing domain registration and renewal processes, ensuring compliance with the chosen policy and avoiding unintentional lapses in domain ownership.

## Examples

To provide a better understanding of how the Registration Policy affects the Expiration Date, here are some examples:

1. The .com extension has a **"Registration Policy"** of Normal. For instance, a .com domain registered on 6-15-2022 for 1 year would have an Expiration Date of 6-15-2023.
2. The .com.ar extension has a **"Registration Policy"** of Minus one day. If a .com.ar domain is registered on 6-15-2022 for 2 years, the Expiration Date would be 6-14-2024.
3. The .com.cy extension has a **"Registration Policy"** of Set to December 31. For example, if a .com.cy domain is registered on 6-15-2022 for 1 year, the Expiration Date would be set to 12-31-2022.

## Special Status: Expired - Recoverable
In certain cases, when a user attempts to renew a domain with the status "Expired - Recoverable," two scenarios may arise based on the calculation involving the "Expiration Date" and the "Grace Period":

### Scenario 1
If the expiration date plus the **"Grace Period"** results in a date that has not yet been reached, the renewal process can proceed in the regular manner. The user can renew the domain without any additional considerations.

### Scenario 2
If the expiration date plus the **"Grace Period"** has already passed, a window message will appear to the user, displaying the following text:

**The Renewal Date for this domain has already passed**

You can still renew the domain; however, please note that there is a late renewal fee for domain redemption.

Alongside this message, the user will be presented with two options:

- **Accept late renewal fee**: This option allows the user to proceed with the renewal request, acknowledging the late renewal fee for domain redemption.
- **Cancel renewal**: This option enables the user to cancel the renewal request without incurring any additional fees.

Only if the user accepts the late renewal fee by clicking the "Accept late renewal fee" button, the domain renewal request will be created and processed accordingly.

This approach ensures that users are informed about the late renewal fee associated with domains that have reached their expiration date plus the grace period. By providing clear instructions and options, users can make informed decisions regarding the renewal of domains in the "Expired - Recoverable" status.
