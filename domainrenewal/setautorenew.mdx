The Set AutoRenew is a free command that allows resellers to update the Auto Renew field for each domain in the domain portfolio.
The Set AutoRenew command belongs to the **"modify"** group, and therefore, it should appear in the **online form modify** section.

Reseller can set the **"SetAutoRenew"** with the available value of **"Yes"** and **"No"** within the Modify command.
<Note>If the reseller wishes to set Auto Renew to **"Yes"**, the current domain date must be at least two days prior to the expiration date. If not, an error message stating **"Auto renewal cannot be activated too close to the expiration date. You need to explicitly renew the domain and then set the auto renewal"**. </Note>
<Note>If a reseller has a domain with the Auto Renew field set to **"Yes"**, all newly created domain portfolios will have the Auto Renew field set to **"Yes"**, and if it is set to **"No"**, all newly created domain portfolios will have the Auto Renew field set to **"No"**.</Note>
