## Special Status: Expired - Recoverable
In certain cases, when a user attempts to renew a domain with the status "Expired - Recoverable," two scenarios may arise based on the calculation involving the "Expiration Date" and the "Grace Period":

### Scenario 1
If the expiration date plus the **"Grace Period"** results in a date that has not yet been reached, the renewal process can proceed in the regular manner. The user can renew the domain without any additional considerations.

### Scenario 2
If the expiration date plus the **"Grace Period"** has already passed, a window message will appear to the user, displaying the following text:

**The Renewal Date for this domain has already passed**

You can still renew the domain; however, please note that there is a late renewal fee for domain redemption.

Alongside this message, the user will be presented with two options:

- **Accept late renewal fee**: This option allows the user to proceed with the renewal request, acknowledging the late renewal fee for domain redemption.
- **Cancel renewal**: This option enables the user to cancel the renewal request without incurring any additional fees.

Only if the user accepts the late renewal fee by clicking the "Accept late renewal fee" button, the domain renewal request will be created and processed accordingly.

This approach ensures that users are informed about the late renewal fee associated with domains that have reached their expiration date plus the grace period. By providing clear instructions and options, users can make informed decisions regarding the renewal of domains in the "Expired - Recoverable" status.
