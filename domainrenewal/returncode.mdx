The **"Return Codes"** page provides a list of possible response codes that can be encountered after sending a command. These codes categorize the outcomes into three types: Successful, Temporary Error, and Permanent Error. The purpose of this page is to document and manage the return codes for better understanding and troubleshooting.
On this page, the admin user can manage the following fields:

- **Text to Display**: The descriptive text that represents the return code.
- **Additional Explanation**: Any additional information or explanation related to the return code.

The other fields, such as the return code itself, type (Successful, Temporary Error, or Permanent Error), and any predefined explanations, are not manageable and are predefined. The **"Retune Codes"** page serves as a reference for understanding the different return codes and their associated meanings. It aids in the interpretation and handling of command responses, facilitating effective troubleshooting and resolution of any issues that may arise during command execution.
