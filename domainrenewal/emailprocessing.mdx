Email Processing facilitates the reseller with the management and tracking of emails. The purpose of introducing email processing is to enable the system to send emails to resellers when specific events related to their domains occur. To minimize the number of emails sent, it is preferred to consolidate relevant information into a single email rather than sending multiple individual emails for each domain. For example, if 10 domains expire for a reseller on the same day, a single email will be sent listing all 10 domains.
Email Processing consists of two main sections: **"Email Items"** and **"XML Pages"**.

## Email Items
The Email Items page will provide essential information regarding each email sent by resellers. The following fields will be included:
- **ID**: This clickable field will allow users to view the specific details related to the item.
- **Created At**: This field displays the date when the item was created.
- **Task Name**: The task that generated the Item ID will be listed here. This will be further explained in the next section.
- **Reseller Name**: The name of the reseller to whom the email is addressed.
- **Reseller Main Email**: This field will contain the primary email address of the reseller. Clicking on the email address will open the default email client with the recipient pre-filled.

## XML Pages
The XML Pages section will list the XML pages utilized for email processing. The XML Pages will be linked to the RSS-Mail platform of Superreseller toÂ send out emails.
