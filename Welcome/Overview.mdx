The **"Process Overview"** provides a framework for managing domains and contacts, with distinct categories of commands and various statuses to track the progress and execution of different operations. It involves several key steps in managing domains, contacts, and related operations. The general description of the process is as follows:

# Command Groups

The **“Command groups”** are categorized as sets of commands that enable the structured management and execution of operations related to domains, contacts. Each group focuses on a specific management aspect, simplifying locating and utilizing the required commands within the domain service ecosystem. The commands are grouped into categories such as **“Domains”, “Contact”**, based on their respective functions and purposes as stated underneath:

| Field    | Description                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Domains  | All commands related to domain management.  |
| Contact  | All commands related to contact management. |
| Requests | All commands related to command requests.   |

To view a comprehensive list of commands, please visit the following link: Commands.

## Command Categories

Commands related to domains, contact, or hosting can be divided into two categories: **"Informational Commands"** and **"Execution Commands"**.

| Command Category       | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Informational Commands | Informational commands only display information about an object. For example, the command "Status Domain" provides details about the current status of a domain. |
| Execution Commands     | Execution commands create, modify, or delete an object. For example, the "Create Domain" command is used to create a new domain.                                 |

<Warning>Be careful when using execution commands as they can perform irreversible actions such as deleting an object permanently.</Warning>

# Domain Requests

The **"Domain Requests"** page displays all the requests related to domain names. It provides essential information about each request, such as the **"request ID, reseller email, command, domain, source, request status, and request date"**. The **“Domain Requests”** are used to generate a unique **“Request Id”** when running an **“Execution Command”** for a domain via API or web form. This **"Domain Request”** tracks the command’s execution. The Request Id is associated with different **“Request Statuses”** that indicate the progress and outcome of the command, including **“In Process”**, **“Pending”**, **“Successful”**, or **“Cancelled”**. This Request Id and its corresponding status are essential for effectively monitoring and managing domain-related operations.

## Domain Request Fields

The essential information for the domain requests fields is displayed in the following table:

| Field          | Description                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Id             | The unique identifier of the request.                          |
| Reseller Email | The email address of the reseller associated with the request. |
| Command        | The command executed for the domain.                           |

- The request was in "Pending" status, and additional fields or documentation were added, resulting in the new status being "In Process".
- A webhook related to the processing item was triggered, updating the status to either "Successful" or "Cancelled".
</Note>

# Service Orders

**"Service Orders"** are triggered when a paid service is involved in the execution of a command. Service Orders ensure proper tracking and invoicing for services rendered.

## Service Order Statuses

 Service Orders help with the accounting process and can have different statuses, such as **"In Process"**, **"Cancelled"**, or **"Invoiced"** stated underneath:

| Status     | Explanation                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| In Process | The Service Order has been created but is not yet active.          |
| Cancelled  | The Service Order has been cancelled, and no invoice is generated. |
| Invoiced   | The Service Order has been completed, and an invoice is generated. |

## Service Order Execution

This section provides an overview of the steps involved in executing a Service Order.

### Step # 1: Triggering a Service Order

- Determine if the command being executed involves a paid service.
- If the command involves a paid service, a Service Order is automatically triggered.

### Step# 2: Monitoring Service Order Status

- Access the **"Process Overview"** option in the system.
- Locate the relevant Service Order for domain registration.

### Step# 3:Check the status of the Service Order to determine its progress.

- If the status is **"In Process"**, the Service Order has been created but is inactive.
- If the status is **"Cancelled"**, the Service Order has been cancelled, and no invoice is generated.
- If the status is **"Invoiced"**, the Service Order has been completed, and an invoice is generated.

### Step# 4: Completing Service Order Execution

- Execute the necessary actions to fulfill the Service Order requirements.
- Once the service is successfully executed (e.g., domain registration is completed), the status is updated to Invoiced.
- An Invoice Id and an Invoice Date are assigned to the Service Order.

# Webhooks

The **"Webhooks"** feature enables users to receive real-time notifications for successful domain registrations or transfers requested through the **"Register Domains"** or **"Transfer Domain"** commands. Setting up a webhook will notify you once a domain is successfully registered or transferred.

## Setting up Webhooks

Follow the steps below to set up the webhook:

1. Obtain a URL to receive the webhook notifications. Ensure that the URL supports the necessary HTTP requests.
2. Construct the webhook URL, including the placeholders [Domain] and [Expiration Date] in the required format (YYYY-MM-DD).
3. Configure your system or application to listen for incoming HTTP requests at the webhook URL.

## Webhook Trigger Conditions

The webhook will only be triggered under the following conditions:

1. The domain requested through the "Register Domains" or "Transfer Domain" commands is not immediately activated.
2. The response code for the domain registration or transfer is 201 or 202.

## Real-Time Domain Registration

If a domain is successfully registered in real-time, the webhook for that domain will not run. In such cases, you can obtain the domain information from the same API used for the registration.

## Checking Domain Status

Setting up the webhook is optional. If you prefer not to use webhooks, you can check the status of your domain using the **"Status"** API command. This command provides information about the domain's registration status.

<Note>Ensure that you have appropriate access and authorization to perform API commands and access domain information.</Note>

## Example Webhook URL:

Here's an example of a webhook URL with the required placeholders:

[Example](https://example.com/webhooks?domain=[Domain]&expiration=[ExpirationDate])

Make sure to replace [Domain] with the actual domain name and [Expiration Date] with the domain's expiration date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

# Process Diagram

The **"Process Diagram"** is a graphical representation that depicts the sequential flow of activities and steps involved in the **"Superreseller"** workflow. It offers a visual and organized overview of tasks, their dependencies on each other, and the overall progression from the beginning to the end.
