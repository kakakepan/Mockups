The Domain Requests feature within the **Superreseller** dashboard enables users to initiate and track domain operations. The associated Request Id and its corresponding status, such as **"In Process"**, **"Pending"**, **"Successful"** or **"Cancelled"**, provide valuable information about the progress and outcome of each command. By effectively monitoring and managing Domain Requests, users can ensure the successful execution of their domain operations, maintain control over their domain portfolio, and optimize their domain management experience.

| Status     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In Process | The "In Process" status signifies that the domain request is currently being executed. When a Domain Request is in this status, it indicates that the system is actively processing the command related to the domain. Users can track the execution progress and expect the requested action to be completed soon.                                                                                  |
| Pending    | The "Pending" status indicates that additional information is required to proceed with the execution of the command. This status serves as a reminder that certain details or input may be missing or incomplete, preventing the system from fully executing the requested action. Users should provide the required information to move the Domain Request towards successful execution.            |
| Cancelled  | The "Successful" status confirms that the requested domain operation has been executed successfully. When a Domain Request achieves this status, users can be assured that the desired action, such as domain registration, transfer, or modification, has been completed without any issues. This status indicates the successful execution and fulfillment of the command.                         |
| Successful | The "Cancelled" status indicates that the Domain Request has been terminated or discontinued before completion. This status may arise due to user intervention or system requirements. When a Domain Request is cancelled, the associated domain operation will not be executed. Users may choose to cancel a request if it is no longer required or if they need to initiate an alternative action. |
