The Contact Requests feature within the **Superreseller** dashboard allows users to initiate and track actions within the domain service. By providing clear status updates, including **"In Process"**, **"Successful"**, and **"Cancelled"**, users can effectively manage and monitor the progress of their contact requests. This transparency enhances communication, enables better decision-making, and empowers users to stay in control of their domain service operations.

| In Process | When a contact request is in the "In Process" status, it indicates that the requested action is currently being executed. This status informs users that the system is actively working on fulfilling the requested action, ensuring transparency and visibility into the progress of the contact request.                                                              |
| Successful | The "Successful" status signifies that the requested contact action has been executed successfully. When a contact request achieves this status, users can be confident that the desired action has been completed without any issues. This status indicates the successful execution of the requested contact operation.                                               |
| Cancelled  | If a contact request is cancelled, it means that the requested action has been terminated or discontinued before completion. This status may arise due to user intervention or system requirements. When a contact request is cancelled, the associated action will not be executed, allowing users to adjust their plans or initiate alternative actions if necessary. |
