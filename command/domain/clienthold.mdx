The **"SetClientHold"** command is used to place a client hold on a domain name. A client hold prevents any changes or modifications to the domain, effectively freezing its state. By utilizing the "SetClientHold" command, the reseller can control the ability to modify or make changes to a domain name by placing or removing a client hold.
The command operates as follows:

| Client HoldValues | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Yes"**            | Sets the client hold to enabled, freezing the domain and disallowing any modifications. |
| **"No"**             | Sets the client hold to disabled, allowing the reseller to make changes to the domain.   |
