The **"SetRenewalLock"** command is used to manage the renewal lock status of a domain name. The renewal lock prevents unauthorized or accidental renewals of the domain. By employing the "SetRenewalLock" command, the reseller can have control over the renewal process and prevent unauthorized renewals of domain names.
The command operates as follows:

| Renewal Lock Values | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Yes"**            | Sets the renewal lock to enabled, restricting the renewal of the domain. |
| **"No"**             | Sets the renewal lock to disabled, allowing the reseller to renew the domain.   |
