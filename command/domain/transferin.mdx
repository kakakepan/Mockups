**TransferIn** is a command that allows us to assume control of an already registered domain. The expiration date of a transferred domain is not dependent on the date the domain was initially entered into the platform; rather, it is dependent on the expiration date that the resellers have explicitly input.
<Note>Please note that we charge for this service, similar to domain registration.</Note>

## Access the TransferIn Command
Access the command by following the steps below:
1. Navigate to the **Superreseller dashboard** [here](https://superreseller-qa.nominus.host/).
2. Select the **Online Form** menu.
3. Click **Transfer** under the **Renew** command.

<Note>
Important things to note:
- Similar to domain registration, some extensions only support the **"Owner"** contact, while others allow for the inclusion of additional contacts such as **"Admin"**, **"Tech"**, and **"Billing"**. 
    This is managed by the `display_full_contact_data` field.
- Trustee Logic is implemented in this command,  For example, if a user requests a .com.br domain and the owner is not from Brazil, a message will appear stating: **"Please note that the Owner does not meet the residency requirement. To register the domain, you need to order a Trustee Service for this domain, which incurs a fee of $XX"**.
- All extensions for this command require additional information or documentation, which will result in requests being set to a **"Pending"** status.
