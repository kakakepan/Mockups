The **"SetDeleteLock"** command is used to set or remove the delete lock on a domain name. The delete lock prevents accidental or unauthorized deletion of the domain. This command ensures the protection of domain names from unintended deletion.
The command operates as follows:

| Delete Lock Values | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **"Yes"**            | Sets the delete lock to enabled, preventing the domain from being deleted |
| **"No"**             | Sets the delete lock to disabled, allowing the reseller to delete the domain if necessary.   |

## Access the Delete Lock Command
