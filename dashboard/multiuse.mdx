The table below illustrates the additional fields required for domain registration based on the domain extension, owner's country, and entity type:

| Field Reusability                         | Yes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Reusability Criteria                      | The field must be marked as **"MULTIUSE: Yes"**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Reusing Field Data                        | When a reseller provides a value for a specific additional field marked as **"MULTIUSE: Yes"**,  such as the **"Owner's Passport / Id Number"**, that value can be reused for future domains that require the same additional field.                                                                                                          |
| Condition for Reuse                       | The owner profile must remain the same for future domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Benefits of Field Reusability             | It saves time and effort by eliminating the need to request the same additional field data multiple times for the same owner profile. Streamlines the domain registration or transfer process by reusing existing additional field data. Reduces data duplication and ensures consistency across domain requests for the same owner profile. |

## Saving Additional Field Type-Multiuse Data at Contact Level

Saving **"Additional Field Type- Multiuse"** Data at the contact level offers significant advantages for handling domain requests. It ensures the availability and consistency of additional field data associated with the contact's profile, promoting accuracy and data integrity. It eliminates redundancy, ensures data availability, and enhances the efficiency of managing domain requests by offering the following functionalities:

1. **Data Storage**  
   When an additional field with the **"MULTIUSE"** type is provided for a domain request, the data is saved at the contact level.
2. **Stored Data**  
   For example, if a reseller provides a passport number or company number for the **"Owner's Passport / Id Number"** field, this data will be stored in the contact's profile.
3. **Data Availability**  
   The stored additional field data is accessible for future domain requests associated with the same contact.

## Domain Request Status

When using the **"Register Domain"** or **"Transfer In Domain"** commands for an extension that triggers an **"Additional field type-Multiuse"**, the domain request status will be affected based on the presence of the additional field in the owner's profile in the following ways:

| Condition                                                                  | Domain Request Status   |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Owner's profile includes the required Additional field type- Misuse        | "In Process" (Code 201) |
| Owner's profile does not include the required Additional field type-Misuse | "Pending" (Code 202)    |

## API Queries

For API queries related to contact information, such as **"Status Contact"** and **"Update Contact"**, the **"Additional fields marked as "MULTIUSE""** will be made visible. This ensures that resellers can access and manage the additional field data when interacting with contact information through API requests.
