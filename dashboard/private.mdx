The Private Registration feature allows resellers to register a domain using data from a proxy company, ensuring that their personal information is not publicly available. 

## Setting Up the Proxy Company

Before using the Private Registration service, resellers need to set up the company information that will be used as the proxy for domain registrations. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the **"PDN Proxy"** page.
2. Enter all the fields related to the company information, for example

| Company Name | PDN Proxy Domain Names         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Address      | 24A Trolley Square, Unit #4048 |
| City         | Wilmington                     |
| Postal       | 19806                          |
| State        | Delaware                       |
| Phone        | 17752428399                    |

3. **"Save"** the changes.

<Note>
- **"Private Registration"** is available for domain extensions that do not require additional information or documentation. 
- If a domain extension offers the option of **"Trustee Service"**, it will never have the "**Private Registration"** feature. The **"Trustee Service"** replaces the need for **"Private Registration"** in such cases.
- **"Private Registration"** is optional where **"Trustee Service"** is not for certain conditions.
- **"Private Registration"** can be added or removed after domain registration, **"Trustee Service"** cannot be added or removed.
