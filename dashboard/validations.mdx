The **"Validation"** feature enables the definition and management of validation rules for fields in the online forms. These validation rules help ensure data accuracy and completeness. Validating the data entered by resellers is crucial to ensure error-free processing and accurate domain registrations.

## Validation Rules

Proper data validation is essential to prevent delays and potential issues with domain registrations. Communicating accurate validation rules to resellers to facilitate proper data submission is equally important. The **"Validation Rules"** page provides an overview of the validation rules for various fields.
