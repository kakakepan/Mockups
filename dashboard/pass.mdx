4. Identify the IP addresses that you want to **"allow"** or **"restrict"** access to the API.
5. If you want to **"Allow access"** for API queries from specific IP addresses only, add those IP addresses to the list of allowed IPs.
6. If you want to **"Restrict access"** for API queries from specific IP addresses, add those IP addresses to the list of restricted IPs.

<Note>While implementing the IP restriction mechanism, make sure ut doesn't impact web access.</Note>
