The **"Dashboard"** provides an overview of various statistics and allows users to access important features and information. 

# Admin and non-admin access

The dashboard includes a **"Reseller"** dropdown at the top. This dropdown enables administrators to view and manage reseller-related data. When administrators access the dropdown, they can easily navigate through the data of **"All Resellers"** with just a few clicks. For admin users, this option is selected by default, providing a quick overview of all resellers and their associated information.

Non-admin users, on the other hand, have a different experience on the dashboard. To simplify their user interface and avoid unnecessary complexity, the Reseller dropdown is not visible to non-admin users. Instead, the dashboard automatically displays data specific to their assigned reseller, allowing them to focus on relevant information without the need for manual selection.

The summary boxes provide a quick overview of the number of records for each category. Click on the numbers in each box to access more detailed information.
