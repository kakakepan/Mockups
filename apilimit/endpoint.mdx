SuperReseller endpoints are specific API endpoints that allow SuperResellers to interact with the system programmatically. They provide functionality for managing reseller accounts, sub-resellers, pricing, reports, billing, customer accounts, and more. SuperResellers can use these endpoints to integrate their own applications, automate tasks, retrieve data, and perform management actions.
