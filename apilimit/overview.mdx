The API section in the SuperReseller dashboard refers to a dedicated area that provides access to the API (Application Programming Interface) functionality. It allows SuperResellers to interact with the system programmatically by making API requests. The API section provides documentation, endpoints, and tools that enable SuperResellers to integrate their own applications, automate processes, retrieve data, and perform various actions within the SuperReseller system.
