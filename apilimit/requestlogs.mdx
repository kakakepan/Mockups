Within the **“API Integration”** option, the **”Request Logs”** capture and store information about domain registration requests, including date, time, actions, and relevant data. They track and audit registration activities, identify errors, track progress, and facilitate issue resolution. By maintaining request logs, SuperReseller can ensure transparency, accountability, and compliance with relevant regulations. These logs also facilitate effective communication and resolution of any inquiries or disputes related to domain registration activities.
