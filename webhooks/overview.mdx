Webhooks within the **Superreseller** dashboard offer users a convenient and efficient method of receiving real-time notifications for domain registrations or transfers. By configuring webhooks with custom URLs and utilizing placeholders for domain-specific information, users can stay updated on their domain activities without constant manual monitoring. This feature enhances workflow automation, integration possibilities, and timely decision-making within the Superreseller ecosystem.

<Note>Webhooks can easily be integrated with Zapier, for more info please see [here](https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/336558/baxv9sg/?domain=%5bDomain%5d&expiration_date=%5bExpirationDate%5d&environment=QA).</Note>
