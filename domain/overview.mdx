The "Domain" feature in the SuperReseller dashboard refers to a section where SuperResellers can manage and oversee their domain registrations. It allows them to view a list of registered domains, perform actions such as domain registration, renewal, transfer, and management tasks like updating DNS settings, managing name servers, and modifying domain contact information. The Domain feature provides a centralized interface for SuperResellers to efficiently manage and monitor their portfolio of domains.
