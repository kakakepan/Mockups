The **"Pending Domains"** page provides a list of all requests that are currently in the **"Pending"** status. The **"Pending Domains"** page consists of a table with three columns: **"Domain"**, **"Command"**, and **"Missing Data"**. The table provides an overview of the pending domain requests:

| ----------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| example.com | Transfer In  | Information     |
| test.com    | Register     | Documentation   |
| foo.com     | Transfer Out | Expiration Date |

## Completing Data

To complete the missing data for a domain request, follow these steps:

1. Locate the domain request in the table.
2. At the right of the record, click on the **"Complete Data"** button.
3. You will be redirected to the corresponding page based on the missing data type:

| Domain      | Missing Data    | Redirect Action                                |

<Warning>
**Caution:**
- The **"Expiration Date"** value for the **"Missing Data"** column applies only to the **"Transfer In"** command.
- The option to set the **"Expiration Date"** is only available for admin users. Non-admin users will not see the **"Expiration Date"** option.
</Warning>

## Updating Pending Domain Requests

When a reseller provides an **"Additional field type-Multiuse"** value for contact with **"pending domain requests"**, the system seamlessly updates the requests with the new information. This automatic process ensures that all **"pending domain requests"** associated with the contact are synchronized with the latest **"Additional field type-Multiuse"** data. 

1. **Streamlined Management Process:** The system automates updating pending domain requests, eliminating the need for manual intervention and reducing administrative burden.
2. **Real-time Access to Latest Information:** Resellers have immediate access to the most up-to-date information for each request, allowing for efficient handling and decision-making.
3. **Data Consistency:** By ensuring that all pending requests reflect the latest additional field data, the system helps maintain data consistency across the platform.

**Example Scenario:**

- Let's consider a situation where there are ten **"pending domain requests**" that require the passport number for contact P-JM00001. 
- When the reseller provides the passport number for this contact, the system promptly updates all ten domain requests with the newly provided information.
- This automatic **"Updating Pending Domain Requests"** process of  **"Additional field type-Multiuse"** eliminates the need for manual updates, ensuring that the pending requests accurately reflect the most current additional field data.
