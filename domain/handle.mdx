The Handle ID is essential for executing the logic of the **"Register Domain"** command.  By obtaining the correct Handle IDs, it can ensure a seamless execution of the **"Register Domain"** command. This user guide provides instructions on how to obtain the Handle ID in **"SuperReseller"** after posting data to the **"Register Domain And Create Contacts"** endpoint.

## Accessing Handle Id

Follow these steps to access Handle Id:

1. After posting the data to the **"Register Domain And Create Contacts"** endpoint, the system needs to check if the entered contact IDs already exist in **"SuperReseller"**.
2. The system should perform a check for each of the following contact IDs: **owner_internal_contact_id**, **admin_internal_contact_id**, **tech_internal_contact_id**, and **billing_internal_contact_id**.
3. If any of the contact IDs are already associated with a contact in **"SuperReseller"**, it means that the contact has already been created. 
4. In this case, the system can proceed to obtain the corresponding Handle ID for each contact.
5. If any of the contact IDs are not found in **"SuperReseller"**, it indicates that the contacts have not been created yet. In this scenario, the system should create the contacts and rerun the process.

## Acquiring Handle Id

Follow these steps to acquire Handle Id:

1. Once the contacts are created (or if they were already present), the system should obtain the Handle ID for each contact. 
2. This Handle ID will be required for executing the logic of the **"Register Domain"** command.
3. Finally, the system can proceed to execute the logic of the **"Register Domain"** command using the obtained Handle IDs.

<Note>
- Accurate association of all required contact IDs with their corresponding contacts is crucial.
- Failing to provide the correct Handle IDs can lead to errors during the execution of the **"Register Domain"** command.
