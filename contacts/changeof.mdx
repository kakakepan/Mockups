The **"Change Of Contacts"** command allows clients to change the contacts associated with a specific domain portfolio. Depending on the domain extension, a domain portfolio might be associated with one or multiple contacts.

Accessing the **"Change of Contacts"** Form:

1. Navigate to the **"Modify Contact Form"** by clicking [here](https://superreseller-qa.nominus.host/forms/domains/modify).

2. Select the appropriate **"Reseller"** and **"Domain"** for which you wish to change contacts.

3. In the command list, select **"Change Of Contacts".** 

<Note>Note: Depending on the domain extension, you might see different contact fields. This is managed by the field `display_full_contact_data`.</Note>

## Before Submission

Before you submit the form, the system checks the following:

- If there's a successful request for the **"Change Of Contacts" **command for the same domain within the last 10 minutes. If so, you'll see the following error message:
  `"Command cannot be executed as there is a previous request for this command that it is in process."`
- If there's a pending request for the** "Change Of Contacts"** command for the same domain. If so, you'll see the following error message:
  `"Command cannot be executed as there is a pending request for this command that is open."`

## Fee for Changing Contacts

Updating contacts for domains that display all four contacts** "(Owner, Admin, Tech, Billing)"** is free. However, if you're updating an **"Owner"** contact for certain extensions, you might be charged a fee. The "**Owner Update Fee" **field in the extension list indicates whether a fee applies.

If you're updating an extension with an **"Owner Update Fee"**, you'll see a warning message after clicking **"Submit"** but before the data is submitted. Only after you click** "Accept Owner Update Fee"** is the form submitted.

## After Submission

Once you submit the form, the following occurs:

- Your data is saved as a request, visible at [this link](https://superreseller-qa.nominus.host/requests/domain).

- The system checks whether the **"Change Of Contacts"** command requires additional information or documentation. Depending on this, the request might be updated with different statuses.

### If Additional Information/Documentation is Needed

If additional information or documentation is needed, the request status is set to **"Pending"**. You can add this additional information or documentation at the following pages:

- [Additional Fields Form](https://superreseller-qa.nominus.host/forms/domains/additional/fields)
- [Additional Documentation Form](https://superreseller-qa.nominus.host/forms/domains/additional/documentation)

Upon adding the necessary data, the original request is updated to **"In Process"**. You also have the option to cancel the request if you're unable to provide the necessary information or documentation.

In this case:
