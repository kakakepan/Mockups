| Active   | When a contact is in the "Active" status, it signifies that the contact information is usable and can be associated with domains. An active contact is ready to be assigned as the registrant, administrative, technical, or billing contact for a domain. Users can rely on active contacts for managing domain-related communication and administrative tasks effectively.                                                                                          |
| Inactive | The "Inactive" status indicates that a contact cannot be used for domain association or any other domain-related activities. Contacts in the inactive state are not eligible for assignment as domain contacts. This status may arise due to various reasons, such as incomplete information or user-defined restrictions. Inactive contacts are temporarily excluded from domain contact usage until they are reactivated or updated with the necessary information. |
