The Reverse webhook is a new type of webhook called **"Reversed"** that allows for the reversal of a request that has already been marked as **"Run Successful"**. While it is not commonly used, this webhook provides a way to handle cases where a completed service needs to be reversed due to certain circumstances.

Previously, once a webhook was marked as **"Run Successful"**, it couldn't be changed to **Sent to Provider"** or **"Cancelled"**. Any attempt to do so would result in an error message stating that the **"Run Successful"** status had already been executed.

With the Reverse webhook, it can only be triggered if the executing item is currently in the **"Run Successful"** status. This ensures that the reversal process can only be initiated when appropriate.

When the Reverse webhook is triggered, specific actions will be taken based on the command that was reversed. These actions are similar to those performed when the **"Cancelled"** webhook is triggered. The exact details of these actions should be reviewed for each command.

By implementing the Reverse webhook, we have a means to handle situations where a previously completed service needs to be reversed. This adds flexibility and control to the management of service requests and ensures that the appropriate actions are taken for reversals.

# Reverse Action list
