The **"Post Webhook"** feature allows resellers to receive notifications when a domain requested through the **"Register Domains"** or **"Transfer Domain"** commands is successfully registered or transferred. This feature enables resellers to be informed by posting a webhook.

## Saving Requested Domains

Whenever the commands **"Register Domains"** or **"Transfer Domain"** are executed and a status code of 201 or 202 is received, the requested domains should be saved in the **"Monitoring Domains For Webhook"**.

## Setting up the Post Webhooks Task

Create a new **"Post Webhooks"** task that will run at regular intervals, preferably every 5 minutes.

### Task Execution:

When the **"Post Webhooks"** task runs, it performs the following steps:

1. Check for **"Updated Domains"**.
   1. Compare the **"Monitoring Domains For Webhook"** with the previous run of the task.
   2. Identify any domains that have been updated to the status **"Registered"** since the last task execution.
2. Verify **"Reseller Webhook Activation"**:
   1. For each newly registered domain, check if it belongs to a reseller with an activated webhook.
   2. Only domains associated with resellers who have enabled webhooks should proceed to the next step.
3. Queue **"Webhook Posting"**:
   1. Implement a queue system for posting webhooks to avoid the simultaneous posting of multiple domains.
   2. Consider posting webhooks sequentially for each reseller. 
   3. Post one webhook, then proceed to the next."
   4. **Webhook Posting"**:
   5. For each reseller with an activated webhook, post the webhook for the corresponding domain.
   6. Ensure that the webhook posting mechanism is designed to handle potential errors and provide appropriate feedback or logging.

## Webhook Setup

The **"Webhook Setup"** page allows resellers to configure the webhook and decide whether to receive notifications when a domain is updated to **"Registered"**.

### Access the Webhook Setup

 Follow the steps below to set up the webhook:

1. Access the **"API Swagger"** and navigate to the **"Webhook"** tab.
2. Click on the **"Webhook Setup"** page.

<Note>
- By setting up **"Post webhook"**, notifications for successfully registered or transferred domains requested will be received through the **"Register Domains"** or **"Transfer Domain"** commands.
- The **"Post webhook"**,will only work for domains that are not immediately activated, indicated by a response code of 201 or 202.
- If a domain is successfully registered in real-time, the **"Post webhook"**, for that domain will not be triggered. In such cases, you can obtain domain information using the same API.
- Setting up this **"Post webhook"**, is optional. The status of the domain can also be checked using the **"Status"** API command
</Note>

3. Click the **"Activate Webhook"** button.
4. A box will appear to enter the **"Webhook URL"**. Enter the URL in the following format:

| URL Format                                                                           | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `www.reseller-website.com/set-domain-registration/domain=[domain]&date=[yyyy-mm-dd]` | The URL for setting domain registration, where [domain] and [yyyy-mm-dd] are placeholders. |
| Replace [domain] with the domain name                                                | Replace the [domain] placeholder in the URL with the actual domain name.                   |
| Replace [yyyy-mm-dd] with the expiration date                                        | Replace the [yyyy-mm-dd] placeholder in the URL with the actual expiration date.           |

<Warning>The URL must include both the domain and date fields, and the format must match the example provided.</Warning>

5. Click **"Save"** to activate the **"Post webhook"**.

## Webhook Logs

The **"Webhook Logs"** page allows resellers and admin users to view the logs of the webhooks that have been triggered. The logs provide information such as the date, domain, and command.

### Access the Webhook Logs

 Follow the instructions below to access the Webhook Logs:

1. Access the **"API Swagger"** and navigate to the **"Webhook"** tab.
2. Click on the **"Webhook Logs"** page.
3. For example, the page will display a table with the following columns:

| Date       | Domain         | Command          |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| 2023-05-15 | example.com    | Register Domains |
| 2023-05-18 | mydomain.org   | Transfer Domain  |
| 2023-05-22 | testdomain.net | Register Domains |
| 2023-05-25 | yourdomain.com | Transfer Domain  |
| 2023-05-30 | newdomain.co   | Register Domains |

<Note>
- As an admin user, you will notice a Reseller drop-down menu located at the top right corner of the page.
- By default, the drop-down menu will display the option **"All Resellers"**, allowing you to view data and perform actions for all resellers in the system.
- However, for specific resellers, the drop-down menu will not be visible, as the system will automatically filter the content and actions based on your assigned reseller privileges.
