The **"Cancelled"** webhook is a type of webhook that is triggered when a service request or order is cancelled or terminated before completion. It serves as a notification mechanism to indicate that the requested service has been cancelled and will not be processed further.

When the "Cancelled" webhook is triggered, it typically initiates a series of actions or updates in the system to handle the cancellation process. These actions can vary depending on the specific context and requirements of the service being processed. 
# Cancelled Action list
