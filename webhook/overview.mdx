A webhook is a mechanism that allows applications or services to communicate with each other in real-time by sending HTTP requests to a specific endpoint or URL when a particular event or trigger occurs. As you interact with the the **"SuperReseller dashboard system"**, it is important to recognize that distinct commands activate various webhooks actions.
