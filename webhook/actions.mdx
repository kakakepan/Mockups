A webhook is a mechanism that allows applications or services to communicate with each other in real-time by sending HTTP requests to a specific endpoint or URL when a particular event or trigger occurs. As you interact with the the **"SuperReseller dashboard system"**, it is important to recognize that distinct commands activate various webhooks actions.
# Webhook for Renew Domain

For the command **"Renew Domain"**, different statuses trigger different actions. 

## Renew Domain – Run Successful

When a webhook is triggered that sets an item to **"Run Successful"**, the following actions are performed:

- **"Executing_Item_Status_Id"** is updated to **"Run Successful"**.

## Renew Domain – Sent to Provider

When a webhook sets an item status to **"Sent to Provider"**, the following changes take place:

- **"Executing_Item_Status_Id"** is updated to **"Sent to Provider"**.

## Renew Domain – Cancelled

When a webhook sets an item status to **"Cancelled"**, several actions are triggered:

| Action                   | Description                                                                              |
